redisapi

This service is used for Redis connections.

Once binded, you will be able to use the following environment variables:

    - REDIS_HOST: the host that you should use in your Redis client.
    - REDIS_PORT: the port that you should use in your Redis client.
    - REDIS_PASSWORD: the password that you should use in your Redis client.
      This environment variable may be undefined, which means that
      authorization is not enabled in the server.
